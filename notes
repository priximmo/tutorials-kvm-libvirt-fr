    copy the VM's disks from /var/lib/libvirt/images on src host to the same dir on destination host
    on the source host run virsh dumpxml VMNAME > domxml.xml and copy this xml to the destination host
    on the destination host run virsh define domxml.xml

start the VM.

    If the disk location differs, you need to edit the xml's devices/disk node to point to the image on the destination host

    If the VM is attached to custom defined networks, you'll need to either edit them out of the xml on the destination host or redefine them as well
        On source machine virsh net-dumpxml NETNAME > netxml.xml
        copy netxml.xml to target machine
        On target machine virsh net-define netxml.xml && virsh net-start NETNAME & virsh net-autostart NETNAME)
